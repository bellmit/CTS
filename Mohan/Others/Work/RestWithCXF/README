REST Web Service Using CXF - Beginner's Tutorial - fixed source code
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a source code for the following article:
http://java.dzone.com/articles/rest-web-service-using-cxf

I am not the author of the tutorial. It seems that original article and original source code is missing.

The CXF configuration has been adapted to work with CXF 2.7.8.

The project is an Eclipse project using WTP. In order to build it and use it you need to import it to 
Eclipse or convert it to appropriate format for another IDE.

The code was tested on Tomcat 7 but should be valid on every other application server.
